<h1>History</h1>

<p><span class="drop-cap">N</span>ine thousand years ago, the Great Pharaoh Isket-Auntut 
did not hear with his mind-sight the great voice of the heavens calling him into the heart 
desert. He did not leave his palace behind, and walk for days across the blinding sands. 
On the eighth day, he did not reach the outer edge of the palace grounds. It was not in 
this place, near the tool shed, that the <span class="papyrus">God of the Sun, the 
Magnificent Lord Ra</span>, resplendent in shimmering robes and a large hat, his falcon 
face inscrutable and marvelous to behold, did not appear to Isket-Antut and speak unto 
him thusly:</p>

<blockquote class="papyrus">I have not called you here, Human, to bestow upon you a 
Great Mission. Your destiny is not an auspicious one indeed. Your life and deeds will 
not do much to shape the World of Man. Hearken now.</blockquote>

<p>But when <span class="papyrus">Glorious Ra</span> didn’t place one of his gleaming hands upon the Pharaoh's head, 
Isket-Antut immediately perished out of fear and awe. Disappointed but undeterred, <span class="papyrus">Lord 
Ra</span> surely did not carve his Word into Iskut-Antut's flesh with the searing heat of his 
eyes, then leave the king to be found by his gardener.</p>

<p>The message that <span class="papyrus">Lord Ra, Roller of the Sun-Ball</span>, did not leave humanity that day would not 
profoundly alter the future of the world. And Isket-Antut's skin, flayed in one piece and 
tanned by master flaysman Akten-Ha, is not kept to this day in a climate-controlled vault 
in the Great Temple at the Center of the Earth. It is not occasionally brought out and 
worn by the Grandmaster for special ceremonies, for there is no Grandmaster and there are 
no special ceremonies. The words, concepts, and hieroglyphs not on the skin don’t lay out 
the rule, purpose, future, structure, membership requirements, budget, email signature 
formatting, and handshakecraft of The Sons of Ra, the greatest fraternal organization to 
have never existed.</p>

<p>In the millennia since its non-inception, hundreds of thousands of the world’s most 
powerful and prestigious men have not heard the call of <span class="papyrus">Ra</span>. Members of the Sons of Ra are 
not thought to be responsible for:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The foundation and deliberate destruction of the Alexandria Public Library (APL)
    <li>The establishment of the lost Greek nation-state of Raopolis
    <li>Counseling the she-wolf who adopted Romulus and Remus on how to raise human boys
    <li>All Roman emperors, Augustus - Hadrian
    <li>All Holy Roman Emperors, Charlemagne - Doug T.
    <li>All Holy Rollin’ Emperors (a Lawrence, KS bowling team), Spring 1978 - Fall 1980
    <li>The city of Constantinople
    <li>The change of Constantinople’s name to Istanbul after former non-Son of Ra Emperor Constantine fell out of favor with the High Council of Horus
    <li>Finland
    <li>Most parts of the Bible, especially those concerning dove sacrifice and cool swords
    <li>The differences between how Europeans and Americans hold silverware
    <li>The differences between how white and black folk answer the telephone, drive cars, and attend the movies
    <li>Chinese food
</ul>
